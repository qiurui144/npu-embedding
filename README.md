# Attune

[English](README.md) · [中文](README.zh.md)

**Private AI Knowledge Companion** — Local-first, globally augmented, increasingly attuned to your expertise.

Attune is a personal AI knowledge base designed for knowledge-intensive professionals (lawyers, patent agents, researchers, consultants). Your professional domain becomes clearer the more you use it; local knowledge answers first, and the system reaches out to the web only when needed. All data is encrypted on your own device — portable across machines, portable across jobs.

## Two product lines

This repository contains two parallel product lines sharing the Chrome extension protocol (`/api/v1/*`):

| Line | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Python prototype** | `src/npu_webhook/` | Fast iteration for algorithms and experimental features. FastAPI + ChromaDB + SQLite FTS5 |
| **Rust production** | [`rust/`](rust/README.md) | Production-grade Private AI Knowledge Companion. Axum + rusqlite + tantivy + usearch + Preact UI |

Validated Python features get promoted to the Rust line. See [`rust/README.md`](rust/README.md) for the full Rust documentation.

## Three pillars (Rust line)

### Active Evolution
It learns from every query without configuration. Local misses become signals; a background `SkillEvolver` periodically asks an LLM to generate synonym expansions that silently improve recall over time. After three months, the same query returns noticeably more relevant results — without any "retrain" button.

### Conversational Companion
RAG Chat is the primary interface. Every answer carries clickable citation chips that open the original source in a side drawer. Sessions persist and search across time — discussions from three weeks ago continue right where they left off.

### Hybrid Intelligence
Local knowledge first. When the local vault has no match, a headless Chrome (or Edge) automatically browses the web — **no API keys, no subscription**. Every answer explicitly labels its origin: local or web. Your professional data stays encrypted at home; public information is fetched live.

---

## Sovereignty & transparency

- **Zero-lock pricing**: you pay only for the software itself + your own LLM tokens (if you choose cloud models). No middleman, no search-API subscription, no hidden fees.
- Argon2id(64MB/3r) + AES-256-GCM field-level encryption + Device Secret multi-factor, all data held locally.
- Single ~30 MB static Rust binary — zero runtime dependencies.
- Cross-device migration via encrypted `.vault-profile` export/import.

## Who it's for

| User | Primary value |
|------|--------------|
| **Lawyers / Patent agents** | Accumulate cases, precedents, and technical disclosures privately; law/patent industry plugins; bring your vault when you change firms |
| **Researchers / Academics** | Conversational retrieval across topics, citations traceable to source paragraphs |
| **Independent consultants / Analysts** | Industry plugins + local + web hybrid retrieval, reuse methodologies across projects |
| **AI power users / Prosumers** | A private version of AI memory: local encryption + pluggable LLM + self-hosted |

## Quick start

### 5 steps from download to first use

1. **Download** the binary from the [Releases](../../releases) page (or `cargo build --release` from source — see below).
2. **Run** `./attune-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18900` (Linux) or double-click `attune-server.exe` (Windows). The first launch creates `~/.local/share/attune/` (or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\attune\`).
3. **Open** `http://localhost:18900/` in your browser. The first-run wizard appears automatically.
4. **Set Master Password** + pick an LLM backend on step 3 (see "AI model platforms" table below for `base_url` / model / pricing). API key is stored encrypted with your master password.
5. **Bind data** in the wizard's last step: drop a file, point at a folder, or skip and use the Items / Reader UI later.

That's it. The Cmd+K palette jumps between Chat, Items, Reader, Sessions, and Settings. Lock the vault from the top bar at any time.

### Rust production line (build from source)

```bash
cd rust
cargo build --release
./target/release/attune-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18900
```

Full documentation: [`rust/README.md`](rust/README.md).

### Python prototype

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn npu_webhook.main:app --reload --port 18900
```

## AI model platforms

Attune speaks the **OpenAI-compatible chat protocol**, so you can plug in any provider that exposes `/v1/chat/completions`. The Settings → AI tab includes a "Quick preset" dropdown that pre-fills `endpoint` + `model` for the providers below — you only paste the API key.

| Provider | base_url | Recommended model | Price (input)* | Get a key |
|----------|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **DeepSeek** | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` | `deepseek-chat` | ¥1 / M tok | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) |
| **Aliyun Qwen** (DashScope) | `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` | `qwen-plus` | ¥4 / M tok | [bailian.console.aliyun.com](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?apiKey=1) |
| **Zhipu GLM** | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` | `glm-4-plus` | ¥50 / M tok | [open.bigmodel.cn](https://open.bigmodel.cn/usercenter/apikeys) |
| **Moonshot Kimi** | `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1` | `moonshot-v1-8k` | ¥12 / M tok | [platform.moonshot.cn](https://platform.moonshot.cn/console/api-keys) |
| **Baichuan** | `https://api.baichuan-ai.com/v1` | `Baichuan4-Turbo` | ¥15 / M tok | [platform.baichuan-ai.com](https://platform.baichuan-ai.com/console/apikey) |
| **Ollama (local)** | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | `qwen2.5:7b` | free / local | `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh \| sh && ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` |
| **OpenAI** | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `gpt-4o-mini` | ~¥3 / M tok | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |

*Pricing is the input-token rate at the time of writing. Check each provider's pricing page for current rates and output-token rates.

**Recommendation**: DeepSeek for daily use (cheapest non-local), Ollama if you have a 16 GB+ GPU, OpenAI when you need maximum quality.
